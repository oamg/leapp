            ## **Thank you for contributing to the Leapp project!**
            Please note that every PR needs to comply with the [Leapp Guidelines](https://leapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#) and must pass all tests in order to be mergable.
            If you want to request a review or rebuild a package in copr, you can use following commands as a comment:
            - **review please** to notify leapp developers of review request
            - **/packit copr-build** to submit a public copr build using packit

            To launch regression testing public members of oamg organization can leave the following comment:
            - **/rerun** to schedule tests using this pr build and leapp-repository*master* as artifacts
            - **/rerun 42** to schedule tests using this pr build and leapp-repository*PR42* as artifacts

            Please [open ticket](https://url.corp.redhat.com/oamg-ci-issue) in case you experience technical problem with the CI. (RH internal only)

            **Note:** In case there are problems with tests not being triggered automatically on new PR/commit or pending for a long time, please consider rerunning the CI by commenting **leapp-ci build** (might require several comments). If the problem persists, contact leapp-infra.
