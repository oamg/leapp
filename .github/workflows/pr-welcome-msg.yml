            ## **Thank you for contributing to the Leapp project!**
            Please note that every PR needs to comply with the [Leapp Guidelines](https://leapp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contributing.html#) and must pass all tests in order to be mergable.
            If you want to re-run tests or request review, you can use following commands as a comment:
            - **leapp-ci build** to run copr build and e2e tests in **OAMG CI**
            - **review please** to notify leapp developers of review request

            Please [open ticket](https://url.corp.redhat.com/oamg-ci-issue) in case you experience technical problem with the CI. (RH internal only)

            **Note:** In case there are problems with tests not being triggered automatically on new PR/commit or pending for a long time, please consider rerunning the CI by commenting **leapp-ci build** (might require several comments). If the problem persists, contact leapp-infra.
